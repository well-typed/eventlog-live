# Examples

This directory contains various example programs. Most are intended to generate eventlog data, and are accompanied by scripts for run them together with an `eventlog-live` binary in various configurations.

The two outliers are `collatzer` and `dumper`. The `collatzer` program is an early illustration of the potential of eventlog processing. The `dumper` program is a simple utility that dumps the eventlog events to the standard output.
